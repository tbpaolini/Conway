A simple implementation of [Conway&#39;s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in C, that I made as an exercise to learn the language. I made two versions: a text based one, that runs on the terminal; and a graphical window version, that uses using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) for the graphics.

There isn't really anything to mess around in the program, besides opening and closing it, as the board size and frame rate are hard coded.  I am aware that there are ways to optimize and improve the code. But since I am new to C/C++, I kept things simple and straightfoward, to be sure that I got the basics right.

On the `bin` folder I included the compiled programs. On the `.vscode` folder I included the compiler configurations; which has a task to build the graphical version, and another task to build the terminal version.
